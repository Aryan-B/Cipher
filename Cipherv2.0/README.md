Chat_Main Dashboard, several ways to connect to the server depending on where it is hosted. If hosting locally, use th IP adress of the PC, if using Ngrok(links the local to a global connection), else you can always test the app on the go by joining through Heroku (A third party service to host the server 24/7, no link required).


**Toasts to let you know the server you are joining**
